# Compression
## Problem
A stranger on the internet is giving away his passwords.
They claim they are encrypted, but you quickly realize that it is only compressed.
You have to get hold of their passwords so that you can [prove them wrong](https://xkcd.com/386/).

## Hints
* `$ file` tells you what type of file something is
* 123 and 240 are hexdumps (not necessarily compression)

## Flag
`bcactf{A_l0t_0f_c0mPr3s510n}`
