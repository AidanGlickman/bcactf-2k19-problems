# Bitwise Operations
## Problem
Your friend has just learned about bitwise operations, and now wants to make a riddle with it.
How can you reverse it and find the secret?

## Required Files:
* `bitwise.py`
* Example solution can be found in `solution.py`

## Hints
* How many different characters could there possibly be? Not too many, one would presume.
* The ASCII code for `{` is 123, and is 125 for `}` *(These will be the highest values you need to use)*

## Flag
`bcactf{hello_world}` *(placeholder flag)*
