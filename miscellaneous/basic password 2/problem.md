# Basic Password 2
## Problem
> Prerequisite(s): `Basic Password 1`

Your company is testing out its new employee portal.
After your previous shot, they made the password a bit more secure, so you can't brute force it anymore.
Rise up to the occasion and demonstrate why a local machine is a bad idea, and having the account credentials on a remote server is a better idea.

## Required Files:
* The file `compiled.exe` is a compiled binary for Windows *(For use on other systems, please compile it yourself)*
* The file `password.c` is the source code *(should not be given to users; contains flag in plaintext)*

## Hints
* What does a compiler actually do? Given source code, what does it output?
* You can run programs, but how does the program know what to do? What ways are there of looking into a program's internals?

## Flag
`bcactf{its_another_password}`
