# Basic Password 1
## Problem
Your company is testing out a new login software, and being one of the CompSec experts, they want you to test it.
They say that they have hidden a key somewhere in the program, and want you to look for it.
Find it, and they might even consider giving you a pay raise...

They have told you that there is a four digit pin on the program to unlock it.

## Required Files:
* The file `compiled.exe` is a compiled binary for Windows *(For use on other systems, please compile it yourself)*
* The file `password.c` is the source code *(should not be given to users; contains flag in plaintext)*
* Example solution can be found in `solution.py`

## Hints
* Is it possible to make a program that can execute something from the command line?
* When you run something, what are exit codes? More specifically, what does exit code 0 mean, and when do you get it?

## Flag
`bcactf{hey_its_a_password}`
