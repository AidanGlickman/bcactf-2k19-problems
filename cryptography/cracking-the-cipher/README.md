# __Cracking the Cipher__
## Problem Statement
Hackers work in the most unlikely of places. We have recently discovered one working in a grocery store (weird), and he was able to print out receipts to pass on information to certain customers. We have obtained one of the receipts, but we cannot tell what it says. 

<table>
  <tr>
    <td colspan="4"><b>Grocery Store Receipt</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><b>Item</b></td>
    <td><b>Unit Price</b></td>
    <td><b>Quant.</b></td>
    <td><b>Overall Price</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Caesar Salad Dressing</td>
    <td>5.99</td>
    <td>4</td>

Can you crack the code and tell us the information within?
The answer should be in the format `bcactf{answer}`.

## Hints
* Look closely at the receipt. Are there any clues to tell you what type of cipher this is?

## Flag
`bcactf{learning_caesar_ciphers_is_fun!}`
