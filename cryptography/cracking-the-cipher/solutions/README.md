# Cracking the Cipher Writeup

## Necessary Tools
* A Caesar cipher tool, whether online or on your device, will be helpful in solving the problem.

## Procedure
1. The code at the bottom of the receipt is encoded with a Caesar cipher.
2. Using a decoding tool, the encoded text should be shifted by 2, revealing that the flag is `bcactf{learning_caesar_ciphers_is_fun!}`

## Flag
`bcactf{learning_caesar_ciphers_is_fun!}`
