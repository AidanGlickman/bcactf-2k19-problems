## Problem Statement
My friend wanted me to try out this python program!
Heâ€™s from Korea so he sent me the text in a way that everyone can understand. Help me run this program!

`70 72 69 6E 74 28 22 62 63 61 7B 61 73 63 69 69 5F 74 61 62 6C 65 73 5F 61 72 65 5F 63 6F 6F 6C 7D 22 29`

## Hints
* Back then, people couldn't send messages internationally. What did they decide to make because of this?

## Flag
`bcactf{ascii_tables_are_cool}`
