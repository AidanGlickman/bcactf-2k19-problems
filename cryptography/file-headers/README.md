# File Headers

## Problem Statement
It looks like the PNG file that holds our flag has been corrupted. My computer isn't able to recognize the file type, maybe it has something to do with how the file type is recognized...

## Hints
* HHD Hex Editor Neo is a good program for editing and viewing the hex contents of a file.
* The title is relevant to the solution of the problem...

## Flag
'bcactf{f1l3_h3ad3rs_r_c00l}
