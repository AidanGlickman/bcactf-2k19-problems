# Tricrypto

## Problem Statement
My friend got a virus that can only be removed after figuring out this flag. He cannot do anything but solve this riddle. This is what it says.
>2147782833254767161455<br/>
>If there are <b>8 BASES</b> on one side and <b>16 BASES</b> on another side, how would you <b>ROTATE</b> them <b>13</b> times until you get them equal?

When you find the flag, wrap it with "bcactf{flagname}". He found out that the number may use ROT13, Base 8, and Base 16.

## Hints
* The subscript letters might help you find out the order of what to use. ROT13, Base 8, and Base 16 will all be used.

## Flag
`bcactf{galftcacb}`
