# Client Side MD5

## Problem Statement
Your friend John made an admin portal to his website, and added a password.
You tell him that client side encryption is bad, but all he does is taunt you and dare you to break it.
How can you skip his password and go to the secrets?

## Hints
* How would one go about viewing the code for a website in a browser?
* MD5 would take too long to test everything - Has someone already made something to fix your problem?

## Flag
