# Diggy Diggy Hole
## Problem
I found this super sketchy website called [hole.sketchy.dev](https://hole.sketchy.dev). Can you help me `dig` up some of its secrets?

Oh, and someone told me that the secrets are `TXT`. I don't know what this means, so good luck!

## Hints
* What does `dig` on Linux do?
* How might you use `dig` to view `TXT`?
* Domain Name System

## Flag
