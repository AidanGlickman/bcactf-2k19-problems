# Corrupted PSD

## Problem Statement
I wanted to use Photoshop to embiggen my **head**, but **er**... something happened. It looks like Photoshop isn't the **signature** image editing program it used to be.

Can you help fix this? [This info may help.](https://www.adobe.com/devnet-apps/photoshop/fileformatashtml)
