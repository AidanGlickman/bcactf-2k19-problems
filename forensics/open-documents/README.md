# Open Documents

## Problem Statement
Yay! I really enjoy using these free and open file standards. I love them so much, that I made a file expressing how much I like using them. Let's enjoy open standards together!

## Hints
* What is the difference between `.doc` and `.docx` files? Why is this difference important?
