# Split the Red Sea Writeup

## Necessary Tools
* An image processor, such as Photoshop.

## Procedure
1. The tool Moses used was a staff, but you should use a wand!
1. Open up the image in Photoshop
1. For a quick solve, use the magic wand tool with a tolerance of 0 and click pretty much anywhere on the image. This should select everything except for the flag. :tada:
1. For a more correct solve, open up open up `Select -> Color Range...` set `Fuziness` to 0 and click anywhere on the image. Delete to reveal the flag. :tada:

## Flag
`bcactf{7w0_r3d5_sdf3wqa}`
