# Public Library Writeup

## Necessary Tools
* Something that can compile and run Java or any other JVM-based language

## Procedure
1. Create a new Java project and ensure that `PublicLibrary.class` is in your classpath.
2. Make a new class that instantiates a `PublicLibrary` instance and prints the result of the `getFlag()` method. [Example code](PublicLibraryTest.java)
3. Run the code, which should print out the flag.
