# Secret Code

## Problem Statement
Agent Reffef recieves a secret message from Agent Nahte, his secret lover. The message says:

Dear Agent Reffef,

I have attached the super secret password to my league account.
You will need to decode it first though.

The rules are simple:

If a line length is divisible by 3 and does not contain & you will grab the nth character from it.
Each time you find a viable line, n will be the next key number written at the top of the file.
(The password length is the number of numbers at the top of the file)
All of these characters put together will be the answer.
hehehe rawr xD ;);););););)

- Agent Nahte
