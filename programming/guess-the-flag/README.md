# Guess the Flag
## Problem
I made a Guess the Flag game! It's in Scratch, what could be easier?
[Click here to access the game.](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/276674047/)

## Hints
* What does `See inside` do?
* There are four scripts: **When flag clicked**, **Reset variables**, **Check flag**, and **Generate flag**. Which one could possibly contain the flag?
